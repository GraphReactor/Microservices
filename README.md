# Microservices
Cypher Annotated Microservices - the Microservices Market from where GraphReactor will pick functions/services to build solutions

This Repo will contain files and folders with Microservices annotated in such way that they could be engaged automatically by GraphReactor algorithm in order to be used in building software or business solutions.

To start with we'll have a JSON file with JSON records as expected by GraphReactor.

Later we can add some code to allow us to drop files and directories into the repo and have them parsed to generate the required JSON records.
